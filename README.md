This portfolio follows its mockup in almost every aspect.

The critical part is the cards carousel. Unfortunately I'haven't finished it beacuse I couldn't implement the proper JS code.

I left it in the portfolio anyway, showing 3 new cards after every button clic instead of hiding card #1 and showing card #4 and so on.

In this project are used the following languages/framework: HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I also used Google Fonts to import Big Shoulder Display font.
